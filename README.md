    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    By following best secure coding practices and not cutting corners is a great start in creating functional and secure software. Making sure I create something that follow the functional requirements without adding extra components that could cause issues down the road. 
    
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    Thinking of how I would access and utilize the software as an end user would help put myself in their shoes. This would give me the mindest of creating a program that takes into account what the user would expect, want and how seamless I would need it to perform task to task.
    
    How do I approach designing software?
    I always approach designing software with the end game in mind. I want to have a strong idea of where I want to go. After that, I think about how I start by building a foundation. From there I will work on a road map that helps me get to where I want to go from beginning middle and end. It is also important to think how I want each part to interact with one another. Will there be inheritance or will I need to have a dervived class. I like to get the design on paper to help create the map so I can refer to it as I create my design.
